\section{System models}
\changebars{We assume a distributed system with state fully replicated across
$k$ sites denoted $\textit{site}_0\ldots \textit{site}_{k-1}$. Each site
hosts a replica, and each replica behaves a deterministic state machine model. Any
service running on the top of that replicated system defines a set of
desirable target properties, in order to deliver a meaningful and good user experience. 
The most representative and important properties are three pillars: a) {\bf Causality}---the
service ensures the monotonicity of user requests within a session and preserving causal dependencies
across clients; b) {\bf State convergence}---all replicas that have executed the same set of operations are
in the same state; c) {\bf Invariant preservation}---the behavior of the system
must obey its specification, which may be defined as a set of invariants that must
be preserved, e.g., that no two users receive the same user id when registering.}{}
