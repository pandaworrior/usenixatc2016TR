\section{Design and Implementation of \coordtool}
\label{ch:por:sect:coord}
In this section we provide a detailed explanation on various points of the design
and implementation of \coordtool, which adapts applications to run with \tool\
and \gemini\ under \PRCN.

\subsection{Design rationale}

To minimize coordination overhead, in addition to apply the analysis presented 
in Section~\ref{ch:por:sect:identify} for statically extracting a minimal set 
of restrictions, we aim to build an efficient coordination service for enforcing
restrictions at runtime. This is challenging due to the following observation.
We observed that there exist several coordination techniques/protocols that can be used
for enforcing a given restriction, such as Paxos, distributed locking, or escrow techniques. However, depending on the
frequency at runtime in which the system receives operations confined by a restriction, different coordination approaches 
lead to different performance tradeoffs. A challenging question
we need to answer is: how to choose a cheapest protocol for a restriction?

Consider the previously mentioned RUBiS example. In this example,
maintaining the invariant that winners always match highest 
bidders requires a restriction between any pair of {\tt placeBid'}
and {\tt closeAuction'}. The simplest coordination policy would be forcing the two types of shadow operations to pay the same coordination
cost for figuring out the existence of concurrent peers. However, this solution yields a very poor performance due to the imbalanced workload
between the two types of shadow operations, i.e., {\tt placeBid'} is more prevalent than {\tt closeAuction'}. As a result, reducing the latency for 
{\tt placeBid'} while maintaining the corresponding ordering constraint will comprise
a good user experience. 

In summary, we propose to build a specialized coordination service called \coordtool\ offering
coordination policies, each of which presents a tradeoff between the cost of each operation and 
the overall cost. This service allows us to use runtime information about the relative frequency of operations
to select an efficient coordination mechanism for a given restriction that has lowest cost.

\subsection{Interfaces}

\end{figure}
In order to accommodate different protocols in \coordtool, we design a set of generic interfaces
for understanding the programmer specified restrictions and invoking proper protocols for ensuring
decided restrictions. Figure~\ref{fig:por:olisipinterface} shows the interfaces that library exposes to programmers. 
{\tt getPermissions} takes the transaction id and the operation name as input, and produces a permission as return.
{\tt waitForBeingExecuted} executes a loop and only exits if the returned permission is locally satisfied. {\tt cleanUp}
function removes all used resources and data structures for executing the corresponding shadow operation. The lifecycle of
every produced shadow operation will be as follows: {\tt getPermission} $\rightarrow$ {\tt waitForBeingExecuted} $\rightarrow$ {\tt cleanUp}.
