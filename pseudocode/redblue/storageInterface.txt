"standard" interface provided by the storage service.  any writes must be temporary table-esque
the interface must be augmented to extract timestamp information.

// commit is used to initiate coordination with the sequencer
commit(ShadowOpId id, Parameters params, WriteSet wset, ReadSetWithTimeStamps rset){
		  send $\langle {\sc commit-request}, id, params, wset, rset \rangle$ to sequencer
		  wait for commit or abort message
		  on abort return NULL
		  on commit return commitSequenceNumber
}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%% sequencer-used interface follows %%%%%%%%%%%%

execute(ShadowOp id, Paramters params, TimeStamp ts, SequenceNumber ns){
  //  apply the operation with timestamp and sequence number as appropriate for reading
}
